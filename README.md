# DiffuserNSFW
This repo contains the code for fine-tunning with a control net stableDiffusion model with nsfw Dataset found on the internet.

#### ControlNet
The ControlNet model was introduced in Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffusion Models by Lvmin Zhang, Anyi Rao, Maneesh Agrawala. It provides a greater degree of control over text-to-image generation by conditioning the model on additional inputs such as edge maps, depth maps, segmentation maps, and keypoints for pose detection.
